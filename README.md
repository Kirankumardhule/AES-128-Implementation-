# üîê AES-128 Implementation in Python  
*A from-scratch implementation of the AES-128 algorithm for educational purposes.*

## Features
- Full encryption/decryption  
- Key expansion  
- Round-by-round debug mode  

## Implementation Credits
This project uses:
- The **AES algorithm** as defined in **[NIST FIPS 197](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.197.pdf)** (the official standard).  
- **S-box and mathematical operations** derived from public domain AES specifications.  

The code was:
- **Developed independently** by [Kirankumardhule] with reference to the standard.   

*(Note: Initial implementation was assisted by AI (DeepSeek) for debugging and structure, but all logic follows the NIST specification.)*
